Competition entry for Kaggle Data Science Competition titled "Airbnb New User Bookings" 
Currently submitting the output from the namesake .py file into "submissions.csv", although the namesake .ipynb file contains essentially the same code.

Have so far tried Adaboosted Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Random Forests (Random Forests seem to have the best performance so far)

Currently listed as "Daniel Munro" on the leaderboard:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/leaderboard
(As long as contest is running, current code may not reflect submission currently on leaderboard)
